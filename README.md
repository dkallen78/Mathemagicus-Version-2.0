# Mathemagicus-Version-2.0

This is a more advanced version of my original Mathemagicus game (will be uploaded later). 

As it stands now, the game has almost all of the code in it to start the game and create and display all of the elements for the game. 

Right now, I just have a simple engine that can advance levels of addition and randomly get a monster based on the players level in that operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). 

Included in this project are the html, css, and js files.
