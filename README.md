# Mathemagicus-Version-2.0

This is a more advanced version of my original Mathemagicus game (will be uploaded later). 

As it stands now, the game has almost all of the code in it to start the game and create and display all of the elements for the game. 

Right now, I just have a simple engine that can advance levels of addition and randomly get a monster based on the players level in that operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). 

Included in this project are the html, css, and js files.

### Update 

Added animations for when the player or the enemy takes damage

### Update 2 

Added basic boss monster functionality

Added transition effects for the character select screen and the dungeon select screen

Moved the getLevel() function to the global scope

### Update 3

Added the Algebra spell to the game. It lets the monster randomly change a simple addition problem into a basic missing term problem. The higher the level of the monster, the more likely it is to cast Algebra.

I also included all of the .gif assets for the game in a .rar file

### Update

Added lots of stuff for learning the first spell and making sure it works properly. Short on time, more details later...

## 11/18/17

### Update

I added the subtraction functionality in and got it working properly.

I also put in the triangle/fireball spell and some flashing animations for that. I had to modify my checkAnswers() function to accept an additional argument that determines how much damage an attack does.

## 11/19/17

## Update

I updated the hint functionality to cover subtraction problems. Since I did that, I could also improve the hints for the algebra/missing term problems. 

### Up next: more spells, determining boss rewards, and unlocking other dungeons
